Getting started is the hardest part.

## Save your first record

### Basic Page Information

The extension automatically parses the title, description, og-image from the webpage and automatically fills in the fields.

We can see an [example](https://sentry.io/welcome/) below.

<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/userguide.png"
  alt="user guide"
/>

The title, description and og-image are originally used for SEO. The search engine could know what does this website do.

- Image: You can set a cover to each database record. We set the image to be the cover by default. Users can deselect it if they don't like it.

- Title / Description: you can change the words as you want.

- Slug: slug is the unique key used for SEO. As you change the title, this field will change automatically. If you want to turn your database into blogs. Slug should be unique and will be display on the url of blog.
