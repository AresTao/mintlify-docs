## Sign-In

## Create your first project

A project is a space connected to a Notion database that can collect multiple records.

### Notion Configuration

#### Clone from the project template

<Warning>
Currently the platform does not support customized database define.
</Warning>

As this is a tool I build for my own need,the structure of the database is fine enough to make a few products of my own including blogs and curated-lists.
<Tip>
The project template is [here](https://storm-patella-019.notion.site/Project-Template-174228d4dc6d80c9b5dbdda98398ff4e)
</Tip>

Clone the template to your own workspace.

#### Get the database_id

You can get the whole database link here
