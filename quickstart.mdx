## Create your first project

A project is a space connected to a Notion database that can collect multiple records.

### Notion Config

#### Clone from the project template

Currently the platform does not support customized database define.

As this is a tool I use myself. The structure of the database is fine enough to make a few products of my own, including blogs, curated-lists.

The project template is [here](https://storm-patella-019.notion.site/Project-Template-174228d4dc6d80c9b5dbdda98398ff4e)

Clone the template to your own workspace.

#### Get the database_id

You can get the whole database link here

  src="/images/notiongetdatabaseid.png"
  alt="notion getdatabaseid"
/>

The link structure is like this.

<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/notiondatabaseid.png"
  alt="notion databaseid"
/>

#### New a Integration

Integration is used to operate Notion through API.

The integration management page is [here](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations)

<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/notionnewintegration.png"
  alt="notion integration1"
/>

Click New Integration.

<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/notionnewintegration2.png"
  alt="notion integration2"
/>

Config the integration.

- Name: It is better to name the integration based on its purpose.

- Workspace: Choose your own workspace where your database will be built in.

- Type: Internal

- Click Save.

<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/notionnewintegration3.png"
  alt="notion integration3"
/>

Continue...

- The "Internal Integration Secret" will be used to config the project.

- Capabilities: Check these three capabilities.

- Click Save.

You can check the Integrations you created here.

#### Connect the database to Integration

### Create Project

- Name: The project's purpose should be clear from its name, with words separated by '-' or '_'.

- Slug: The slug is automatically generated by the system based on the name

- IntegrationSecret: Get the Integration Secret from Integration section

- DatabaseId: Refer to the "Get the database_id" section. Make sure that the IntegrationSecret and Database is connected.

## Create a API key

Create a API key here: [API Keys](https://infotobiz.com/dashboard/settings/tokens)

## Install the browser extension

Get the extension from here: [Chrome Extension](https://infotobiz.com/dashboard/settings/tokens)

### Authentication

Open a url, move your mouse arrow to the bottom right of the page, and the extension will pop up. Click to enter the API Key for authentication

After successfully verifying the API Key, it will automatically redirect to the operation page. The API Key will be encrypted and stored locally in your browser
