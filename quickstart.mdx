## Create your first project

A project is a space connected to a Notion database that can collect multiple records.

### Notion Config

#### Clone from the project template

Currently the platform does not support customized database define.

As this is a tool I use myself. The structure of the database is fine enough to make a few products of my own, including blogs, curated-lists.

The project template is [here](https://storm-patella-019.notion.site/Project-Template-174228d4dc6d80c9b5dbdda98398ff4e)

Clone the template to your own workspace.

#### Get the database_id

You can get the whole database link here

  src="/images/notiongetdatabaseid.png"
  alt="notion getdatabaseid"
/>

The link structure is like this.

<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/notiondatabaseid.png"
  alt="notion databaseid"
/>

#### New a Integration

Integration is used to operate Notion through API.

The integration management page is [here](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations)

<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/notionnewintegration.png"
  alt="notion integration1"
/>

Click New Integration.

<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/notionnewintegration2.png"
  alt="notion integration2"
/>

Config the integration.

- Name: It is better to name the integration based on its purpose.

- Workspace: Choose your own workspace where your database will be built in.

- Type: Internal

- Click Save.

<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/notionnewintegration3.png"
  alt="notion integration3"
/>

Continue...

- The "Internal Integration Secret" will be used to config the project.

- Capabilities: Check these three capabilities.

- Click Save.

  src="/images/notionintegration.png"
  alt="notion integration"
/>

You can check the Integrations you created here.

#### Connect the database to Integration

<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/notionconnecttodatabase.png"
  alt="notion integration"
/>

### Create Project

- Name: The project's purpose should be clear from its name, with words separated by '-' or '_'.

- Slug: The slug is automatically generated by the system based on the name

- IntegrationSecret: Get the Integration Secret from Integration section

- DatabaseId: Refer to the "Get the database_id" section. Make sure that the IntegrationSecret and Database is connected.

## Create a API key

Create a API key here: [API Keys](https://infotobiz.com/dashboard/settings/tokens)

<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/createapitoken.png"
  alt="notion token"
/>

## Install the browser extension

Get the extension from here: [Chrome Extension](https://infotobiz.com/dashboard/settings/tokens)

### Authentication

Open a webpage, move your mouse to the bottom right of the page, and the plugin will pop up. Click to enter the api key for authentication

Upon successful authentication, it will automatically redirect to the operation page. The api key will be encrypted and stored locally in your browser

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
