## Invalid page cover URL

### Case

https://www.documind.chat/ 

After you open the extension, You can see the image. 
<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/example1.png"
  alt="example1"
/>

But when you save the record. You will get this error.
<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/example2.png"
  alt="example2"
/>

The reason is that, not all image path can be set to record cover in Notion.

### Solution

Deselect the "Set Cover" and save again.
<img
  className="rounded-2xl"
  src="/images/example3.png"
  alt="example3"
/>

Then click the View button and upload the cover manually.
